## Django CMS One-Click Deploy

**Django CMS** is an open-source content management system with user-friendly interface and rich feature set built for needs of multilingual publishing. Django CMS is aimed at helping developers to take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible, avoiding common security issues, and flexibly scaling your busy websites.

### Environment Topology

The JPS package creates a Python-based environment, which initially contains a single Apache application server, and deploys the Django CMS software.
